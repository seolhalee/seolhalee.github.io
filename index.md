## Bio

Hi, I'm a first year PhD student in [Informatics at University California, Irvine](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/).   

I do research in **data and information systems in urban planning & design** in cities. My works question how we deal with messy data in urban governance, where both big data analytics and community mapping happen at the same time. By answering the questions, I pursue to find ways to make the practices democratic and inclusive.


Some topics I have addressed in my works are: 
- Urban communities, activism, and digital media; 
- Spatial patterns of social networks; 
- Social diversity in commercial places in Korean and American cities.

Before I joined the current program, I studied urban planning at Georgia Tech, civil engineering and geography at Seoul National University in South Korea. There I found my interests in the power of data that can either support or suppress people in cities. 

I have also practiced as a strategic designer/data analyst in urban planning & design organizations in South Korea and the US. 

My work often happens in front of computer screens,  but the most exciting part of my works happens while I'm interacting with real people on streets.
