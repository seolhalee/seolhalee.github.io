## Bio

I'm a master's student in [City and Regional Planning at Georgia Institute of Technology](https://planning.gatech.edu/).   
At the nexus of human, technology, and physical space, I combine computational and qualitative methods to:   
- Capture **collective perceptions and behaviors** of people in cities using new sources of data, focusing on **social gaps and power dynamics** in cities     
- Answer the questions regarding **social justice and injustice performed through digital media and technologies in how people learn, experience, and shape physical space**   

I'm currently part of [Friendly Cities Lab](http://friendlycities.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I explore social flows and spatial behaviors to promote social health and joy in cities with a marvelous team.   

Before I joined the current program, I studied Civil & Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea, with a minor in Geography. I focused on **recovering overlooked dimensions of experience in built environment** using both quantitative and qualitative methods.   

While pursuing academic enthusiasm, I worked in practice as a strategic designer/GIS analyst in an urban planning & design studio for 2 years, designing and implementing a variety of **participatory planning/design** projects    

Throughout my works, I pursue to find ways to **_embrace plurality_** of urban experiences in planning/design practices for better **_solidarity_** in cities.
