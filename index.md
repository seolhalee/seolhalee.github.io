## Bio

I'm a master student in [City and Regional Planning at Georgia Institute of Technology](https://planning.gatech.edu/).   
At the nexus of human, technology, and physical space, I combine computational and qualitative methods to:   
- Measure **collective perceptions and behaviors** of people in cities using new sources of data  
- Answer the questions regarding **the social good and bad of digital technologies in how people learn, access, and experience physical space** 

I'm currently part of [Friendly Cities Lab](http://friendlycities.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I explore social flows and spatial behaviors to promote social health and joy in cities with a marvelous team. 


Before I joined the current program, I studied Civil & Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea, with a minor in Geography. I focused on **inferring complex functionality and identity of places** and **assessing their experiential quality** (activity and perception) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. 

While pursuing academic enthusiasm, I worked in practice as a strategic designer/GIS analyst in an urban planning & design studio for 2 years, designing and implementing a variety of participatory planning processes.
