## Bio

I'm a master student in City and Regional Planning at Georgia Institute of Technology.   
At the nexus of human, technology and physical space, I combine computational and qualitative methods to achieve:   
- Understanding human perception and behaviors in cities using new sources of data  
- Exploring the good and bad of digital technologies in how people learn, access, and experience physcial space  

I'm currently part of [Friendly Cities Lab](http://friendlycities.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I explore social flows and spatial behaviors to promote social health and joy in cities with a marvelous team. 


Before I joined the current program, I studied Civil & Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea, with minor in Geography. I focused on **inferring complex functionality and identity of places** and **assessing their experiential quality** (activity and perception) using both quantitative and qualitative methods. 

While pursuing academic enthusiasm, I worked in practice as strategic designer/GIS analyst in an urban planning & design studio for 2 years, designing and implementing variety of participatory planning processes.
