## Bio

I'm a master student in City and Regional Planning at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
At the nexus of human, technology and physical space, I combine data analytics, qualitative method, design research to achieve:   
- Understanding human perception and behaviors in cities using new sources of data  
- Exploring good and bad of digital technologies in how people learn, access, and experience physcial space  

I'm currently part of Friendly Cities Lab at Georgia Tech, where I explore social flows and spatial behaviors to promote social health and joy in cities with a marvelous team. 


Before I joined the current program, I studied civil & environmental engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea, with minor in geography. This combination allowed me to develop design oriented mind as an engineer with but subjective dimension of human activity in urban spaces.  

While pursuing academic enthusiasm, I worked in practice as strategic designer/GIS analyst in an urban planning & design studio for 2 years, designing and implementing variety of participatory planning processes.
