### What Politics Can Social Media Play in Urban Development: A Case Study of an Anti-redevelopment Movement in Euljiro Street in Seoul

_Master's thesis, Working Paper, 2019-2021_  
<p>In this study, I examine the use and impact of social media in an anti-redevelopment movement ongoing in an old manufacturing district called ‘Euljiro’ in Seoul, South Korea. I used a mixed approach, combining in-depth interviews and social media text analysis to capture the different perceptions posed on the area by different groups and to figure out the impact of social media activities on community building and public discourse.

### Inferring the Commercial Landscape using Age-biased Online Search Results
_Conference Paper, In UbiComp 2019 Adjunct Proceedings_  
<p>What does the different result of age-biased place recommendation tell us about a place? How does the restaurant preference of different age groups correlate with actual commercial activities at a place? In this study, we analyzed the consumer-age-specific patterns of restaurant preferences in commercial areas of Seoul, through the mining of place recommendation results from the Naver Place online service. Our results suggest that both high-traffic and rapidly changing commercial areas present diverse options appealing to all age groups and that this diversity is primarily driven by the tastes of younger age groups. <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1145/3341162.3349322">Read the paper</a></p>

### COVID-19 Event Risk Planner  
_Interactive Map, Web Development, 2020_    
<p>I designed and developed an interactive map tool to inform the expected risk of gatherings and group events in each county in the US, as a part of the COVID-19 Event Risk Planner web tool developed by Weitz Team at Georgia Tech BioScience. The web app has been gathering huge public attention and featured in Fast Company, AJC, and other press.

### Who Has Local, Global, Glocal Set of Connections?: Classifying Individual Spatial and Social Networks
_Conference Paper, NARSC 2020_  
<p>All individuals connect to a set of places with which they interact through travel, migration, location of social ties, telecommunication, and more abstract thoughts and proclivities. Collectively, these are known as social flows and form a star-like pattern that is spatially embedded. In this study we classify the connection sets (e.g.travel, migration, relationships, etc) reported from a survey into distinct typologies and investigated their correlation with individual and behavioral factors regarding social, spatial extensibility. <a href = "/pdf/NARSC2020Abstract.pdf">Read the abstract</a></p>

### Digital Cultural Probing Tool: Collecting Lived Experiences of Senior Immigrant Communities
_Course Project, ICT and Global Development (Technology & Equity), Georgia Tech, 2020_  
<p>Immigrant populations, especially those of senior age, encounter intersectional barriers to community engagement in urban planning. Eurocentric city planning discourages them to reflect on their lived experiences in respective home countries. The language and cultural barrier hinder authentic communication between authorities and immigrants. To overcome these barriers, we developed a digital cultural probing tool that collects lived experiences, memory, narrative, and artifacts. We aimed to support city planners with this tool that enables learning about ways of planning outside of conventional Western methods. <a href = "pdf/T&E_Final_Report.pdf">Read our final report.</a></p>

### Returning Gendered Playground to All: Participatory Design for Inclusive Playful Places 
_Pariticipatory Design Workshop, Yangji.Co.Ltd, 2018_  
<p>During the urban regeneration project in Cheon-an, South Korea, we run an open studio, where residents can walk in and freely participate in the urban design process with architects, planners, and designers. Conversation with elderly women revealed that the neighborhood didn't have a place for elderly women to PLAY. With additional field investigations with the residents, we found that most of the public spaces in the neighborhood are highly masculinized: the huge shade under the bridge was used as a gambling yard for old men, and the enclosed green spaces were rarely used by women because they felt unsafe and even threatened in those spaces. These findings led us to aim to return the gendered, threatening playground to all. In the final pesentation, we suggested to redesign the public spaces with three design principles: to make the places visually open, connected as a network accessible to all, and to place more inclusive and engaging programs.</p>

### Mobile App for Commutnity Engagement
_Mobile App Prototyping and Pilot Implementation, Yangji.Co.Ltd, 2018_  
<p>Namsan-Maeul Talk is a mobile app to help people understand convoluted urban plans and enable them to engage in the process ubiquitously. In a series of participatory workshops, many residents told us that they had a hard time understanding the plans and announcements which hindered them to discuss the issues with others. To lower these barriers and help citizens to be better aware of the process of plan implementation, this app provides residents a real-time progress dashboard and proactive notifications of any actions or changes pertaining to the plans. It also provides a platform for organizing neighborhood events. The app was introduced as a pilot program and tested on-site during the workshop period.</p>

### Indigenous Eco(-nomic) System: Community Mapping and Networking of Local Assets for Economic Empowerment
_Participatory Workshop, Strategic Design, Yangji.Co.Ltd, 2017_  
<p>What would be the way for a shrinking community in a rural island to reinvigorate their tourism economy while they prevent an enormous foreign capital poured in? In the participatory workshop held on an island currently under threat of massive development, we recovered overlooked components of an indigenous ecosystem and created a network of local assets that helps to create sustainable profit-making programs. The result inspired a community-led economic development project which was implemented following the workshop.</p>

### Augmenting the Visaul Experience on GPS Tracks using ML Techniques 
_Course Project, Urban Ecological Design, 2019_    
<p>GPS tracking gives us granular spatio-temporal information about how people move and do things in cities, yet the experiential context we can earn from the data is highly limited. In this class project,  I adopted machine learning algorithms (classification and image segmentation) to infer two contextual information of daily movements from GPS track data: 1) trip purpose and mode, 2) visual component achieved along a trip. Trips for a day of 860 individuals in Tokyo, Japan were processed and the result answers the following questions: Where do people pass by for their daily trips? How would be the scenes they see along with their trips? Is it different when you take a trip for different purposes? like when you commute, do some daily tasks, or go to hang out? </p>
